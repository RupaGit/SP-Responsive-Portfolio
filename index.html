                        <p id="myDetails1"> Hello, Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Swarupa Popuri and I am a mother of two wonderful boys. I work as a Quality Assurance team lead in a well known advertising software provider in New York city. I live on Long Island with my family.
                        <br> <br>I have completed my M.Sc in computer science from a well known university in India and graduated with 4.0 GPA. <br>
                        I have over 9 years of experience in QA field. In the past 9 years, I have worked in various fields such as e-commerce, education software, banking and Advertising. I am very passionate about what I work on and I have received many awards for my performance. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In my spare time, I usually like to spend my time cooking, painting, travelling. I also like to play board games with my kids. In the coming years, I'd like to spend some of my spare time volunteering. I am a big fan of animated movies and I think I am more excited about watching
                        them than my kids. I am running out of ideas to write about myself. Hope this gives enough details about me. Once again, thank you for visiting my page.
